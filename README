Make sure to include ij.jar on the classpath when compiling 
the Java file.

OR: Copy the Java file to the ImageJ PlugIns folder and choose
Compile and Run in the Plugins dropdown menu of ImageJ.

Current Issues:
- Need to be able to generate symlinks in the folder of selected
  images
- Address platform-independence when generating symlinks
- Figure out a more intuitive way to execute shell commands
  from Java file
	- Currently using java.lang.Runtime and java.lang.Process
