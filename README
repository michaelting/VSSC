#=======#
# Usage #
#=======#

* Place the plugin file in the ImageJ plugins folder.
* Open ImageJ and compile and run the plugin.
* The plugin will prompt you to open an image.
* You can cycle between images in the folder (alphabetically)
  by pressing the left and right arrow keys.

# Notes #
#=======#

Make sure to include ij.jar on the classpath when compiling 
the Java file.

OR: 

Copy the Java file to the ImageJ PlugIns folder and choose
Compile and Run in the Plugins dropdown menu of ImageJ. Ensure
that ImageJ is using the correct JRE (if outdated, deleting
ImageJ's JRE will default the JRE to the system's JRE).

# Issues #
#========#

Immediate Issues:
- Use threading for image cycling (Virtual Stack?)
- Both symlinks are overwritten when re-writing the first symlink
	- Figure out why this is happening, although not
	  a major issue since the plugin still works

Current Issues:
- (?) Address platform-independence when generating symlinks
- Figure out a more intuitive way to execute shell commands
  from Java file
	- Currently using java.lang.Runtime and java.lang.Process
	- Apache Commons Exec?
