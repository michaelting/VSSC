Make sure to include ij.jar on the classpath when compiling 
the Java file.

OR: 

Copy the Java file to the ImageJ PlugIns folder and choose
Compile and Run in the Plugins dropdown menu of ImageJ. Ensure
that ImageJ is using the correct JRE (if outdated, deleting
ImageJ's JRE will default the JRE to the system's JRE).

Immediate Issues:
- Implement KeyListener interface to allow for image cycling in
  the current folder
- Use threading for image cycling (Virtual Stack?)

Current Issues:
- (?) Address platform-independence when generating symlinks
- Figure out a more intuitive way to execute shell commands
  from Java file
	- Currently using java.lang.Runtime and java.lang.Process
	- Apache Commons Exec?
